# Student Coding Repository - Body of Work

### <ins>General Overview<ins>

The structure of this GitHub is arranged to have the majority of coding assignments done in my undergraduate classes compiled by year, then by course name including the language coded in (generally). This is meant to be a resource for anyone provided with my resume or GitHub repository link to have a better grasp on my coding experience as taught by Auburn University in my classes, not including other repositories for Undergraduate Research or personal projects.

As an important note, I **_<ins>have not<ins>_** written all parts of all files in this GitHub; some entire files were provided to me as part of the assignment, some files were partially complete, and some were entirely opened-ended coding. I have (to the best of my ability) read over old assignments and designated files as those 3 categories of **1) Provided to me**, **2) Partially Written by me**, and **3) Predominantly Written by me**. For 3, I refer to more than 95% of the written code was opened-ended, with some hints or small sections provided as starter code in the assignment instructions.
