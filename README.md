# Student Coding Repository - Body of Work

### <ins>General Overview<ins>

The structure of this GitHub is arranged to have the majority of coding assignments done in my undergraduate classes compiled reverse chronologically by semester taken , then by course name including the language coded in (generally). This is meant to be a resource for anyone provided with my resume or GitHub repository link to have a better grasp on my coding experience as taught by Auburn University in my classes, but not including other repositories related to Undergraduate Research experience or personal projects.

As an important note, I **_<ins>have not<ins>_** written all parts of all files in this GitHub; some entire files were provided to me in lectures and saved on my computer for studying purposes, other entire files as part of the assignment (i.e. given 2 files and instructed to write/complete the 3rd), some were partially complete, and some were entirely opened-ended coding. I have (to the best of my ability) read over old assignments and designated files as those 3 categories of **1) Provided to me**, **2) Partially Written by me**, and **3) Predominantly Written by me**. For 3, I refer to more than 95% of the written code was opened-ended, with some hints or small sections provided as starter code in the assignment instructions. 

I have tried to label all relevant files with a 1, 2, or 3 in front for clarity; any files not labeled are what I deemed unimportant or not incredibly relevant, but they aren't hidden, so feel free to look through them as well.

### COMP 3270 - Intro to Algorithms (Java)

The majority of this class was conceptual and lecture-based opened-ended questions, which is why there are only 2 coding assignments. Concepts like Search, Recursion, Loop Invariants, and Data structures were revisited while new concepts like Big O Notation and Complexity classes (P, NP, NP hard, etc.) were introduced and throroughly explained. 

Assignment 1 focuses on implementing different types of Search algorithms, specifically writing code for SelectionSort, MergeSort, QuickSort, and InsertionSort algorithms and all helper/assisting functions if necessary. There are also time functions inside, as part of the assignment was to track the average speed of each.

Assignment 2 focuses on building an undirected, connected graph and then evaluating both Breath First Search and Depth First Search on the graph when traveling between all nodes. Again, time functions were included as part of the assignment to track performance. 


### COMP 3220 - Principles of Programming Langauges (Ruby, Ada, Racket)

This class was focused on breaking down how programming languages function, introducing and covering many different programming languages in order to best explain various concepts. Modules 1-3 are in Ruby and build off each other from a lexer to a parser to an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) in the custom-created language "tiny". The 4th module utilizes Racket to learn managing variable and function behavior in the proper environment. Lastly, the 5th module is in Ada and includes functions for binary operations like addition and subtraction; main.adb is **2** because I did not write the test cases, I only filled in my numbers and added debugging print statements.

### COMP 2710 - Software Construction (C++)

This class introduces C++ programming, Git version control (i.e. Ubuntu terminal), and augments concepts found in COMP 2210. It also discusses further topics like memory management (i.e. garbage collection, memory pointer addressing), deadlock prevention, and resource distribution. The coding for this class was largely indepedent, as 4/5 major projects were given with instructions but no template. However, the last 2 assignments - Project5 and FinalExam - are conceptual assignments where students were asked to fill in critical lines to almost complete code relating to semaphores and the Dining Philosopher's problem respectively. 

For Project3, there are three files (the submission, v1, and v2) created because of assignment instructions that asked for an original version, a second verision, and then a final version that merged those two together using Git commands. 


### COMP 3350 - Computer Organizaion and Assembly Language Programming (MIPS)

This class explores higher level concepts and the direct, intricate relationship between programming languages and hardware components. Most coding files are indpendent assignment, apart from the first lab, and are written in MIPS Assembly. It focuses on understanding interaction of parts like the ALU, CPU, Databuses, and Registers on low levels on computer function and control.

### COMP 2210 - Fundamentals of Computing II (Java)

This second-level course is a direct sequel to COMP 1210 that reiterates on concepts introduced, expands into more complicated topics, and introduces new, relevant ideas. It is split into 7 modules, with many code samples and partial completion files to compliment 1-2 main student assignment files based on the concepts of that unit. After reviewing code, it seems that not every module has a file, which could be because of course structure (i.e. no file due on midterms week) or because of a misplaced file in another folder. 

Some modules build on the previous to improve and reimpliment similar functions; for example, M2 implemented Selector.java differently than M1 based on new concepts in the course. Typically (but not always), the assignment in a module relates to the previous module (M2 Selector.java utilizes Generics while M1 does not) because the files are saved as the course progressed. So, an assignment for M1 concepts was due during the M2 unit and are organized as such. The main files for each unit are: 
  * M1 Generics, Iterators, Collections - Selector.java
  * M2 Sorting, Recursion - Selector.java
  * M3 Bags, Array, Node-based Implementation - Term.java
  * M4 Lists, Stacks, Queues - LinkedSet.java
  * M5 Binary, AVL, Red-Black Trees - LinkedSet.java (same as M4)
  * M6 Hashtables, Graphs - Doublets.java, DoubletsTreeSet.java
  * M7 Disjoint Sets, Union-Find Trees - Doublets.java (same as M6)

### COMP 1210 - Fundamentals of Computing I (Java)

This is the first-level coding class required at Auburn. When I took it, it consisted of a lecture section and lab section, where the correspondent lab section predominantly consisted of online coding through ZyBooks that I do not have access to. It is largely an introductory course into coding, and as such the assignments are similar to provided code examples included.
