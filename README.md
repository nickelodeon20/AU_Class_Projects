# Student Coding Repository - Body of Work

### <ins>General Overview<ins>

The structure of this GitHub is arranged to have the majority of coding assignments done in my undergraduate classes compiled by year, then by course name including the language coded in (generally). This is meant to be a resource for anyone provided with my resume or GitHub repository link to have a better grasp on my coding experience as taught by Auburn University in my classes, but not including other repositories related to Undergraduate Research experience or personal projects.

As an important note, I **_<ins>have not<ins>_** written all parts of all files in this GitHub; some entire files were provided to me in lectures and saved on my computer for studying purposes, other entire files as part of the assignment (i.e. given 2 files and instructed to write/complete the 3rd), some were partially complete, and some were entirely opened-ended coding. I have (to the best of my ability) read over old assignments and designated files as those 3 categories of **1) Provided to me**, **2) Partially Written by me**, and **3) Predominantly Written by me**. For 3, I refer to more than 95% of the written code was opened-ended, with some hints or small sections provided as starter code in the assignment instructions. 

I have tried to label all relevant files with a 1, 2, or 3 in front for clarity; any files not labeled are what I deemed unimportant or not relatively relevant, but they aren't hidden, so feel free to look through them as well.

##### COMP 1210 - Fundamentals of Computing I

This is the first-level coding class required at Auburn. When I took it, it consisted of a lecture section and lab section, where the correspondent lab section predominantly consisted of online coding through ZyBooks that I do not have access to. It is largely an introductory course into coding, and as such the assignments are similar to provided code examples included.

##### COMP 2210 - Fundamentals of Computing II

This second-level course is a direct sequel to COMP 1210 that reiterates on concepts introduced, expands into more complicated topics, and introduces new, relevant ideas. It is split into 7 modules, with many code samples and partial completion files to compliment 1-2 main student assignment files based on the concepts of that unit.

Most units build on the previous to improve and reimpliment similar functions; for example, M2 implemented Selector.java differently than M1 based on new concepts in the course. Typically (but not always), the assignment in a module relates to the previous module (M2 Selector.java utilizes Generics while M1 does not) because the files are saved as the course progressed. So, an assignment for M1 concepts was due during the M2 unit and are organized as such. The main files for each unit are: 
  * M1 Generics, Iterators, Collections - Selector.java
  * M2 Sorting, Recursion - Selector.java
